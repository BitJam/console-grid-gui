Is there an existing cli wrapper around apt-get and friends?  Google is not
very useful since so many programs include "apt-get" in their install
instructions.

There are other programs that also may need a wrapper to be usefully called
from a menu.  I might want to punt on this (put it off) for now.

May require some work:
    apt-get!!    (may need work to make useful)
    apt-search!!
    antiX-paste (will require work/wrappper)

Additions, Corrections welcome.  Please mark with "@" so I can
find them easily.
